This might be my favourite project i have ever done in my school, ITTS "O.Belluzzi - L. da Vinci", like a year ago i was try programming a basic arduino, and now i'm programming in micropython the ESP32, in this repository you can found:

-The 3d project of the robot

-The library we use for making it move

-The bluetooth serial chat that i developed

-How to give him the basic inputs (example: for moving it straight or make it turn right) 
 
-All the photo and poster we made (unfortunatly only in italian)
